# Grammar-autocorrector
Modular grammar auto-correction system using rule-based NLP and transformers.

**Problem Statement**

Many English learners and casual writers make basic grammatical errors such as spelling mistakes, incorrect articles, and subject–verb agreement errors.
This project builds a modular grammar auto-correction system that detects and corrects simple grammatical errors using a combination of rule-based NLP, statistical methods, and transformer models.
