# Grammar-autocorrector
Modular grammar auto-correction system using rule-based NLP and transformers.

**Problem Statement**

Many English learners and casual writers make basic grammatical errors such as spelling mistakes, incorrect articles, and subject–verb agreement errors.
This project builds a modular grammar auto-correction system that detects and corrects simple grammatical errors using a combination of rule-based NLP, statistical methods, and transformer models.


## Scope
### Supported
- Spelling errors
- Subject–verb agreement
- Article errors
- Simple tense errors

### Not Supported (yet)
- Style rewriting
- Paraphrasing
- Complex discourse-level grammar

## Project Structure
(brief tree)

## Approach
- Rule-based grammar correction
- Statistical spell checking
- Machine learning for error detection
- Transformer-based correction (later phase)

## Learning Goals
- Error taxonomy in NLP
- Precision vs Recall trade-offs
- Hybrid NLP systems

## Status
🚧 Phase 0: Project setup & scoping
